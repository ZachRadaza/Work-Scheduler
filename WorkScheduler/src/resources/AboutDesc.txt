This application automates employee scheduling by generating optimized shift assignments based on station hours and individual employee availability. Users input the operational hours for different workstations and the availability of each employee. The system then intelligently creates a schedule that ensures coverage across all required stations while respecting employee constraints. Designed to save time and reduce scheduling conflicts, this tool is ideal for managers seeking efficient, conflict-free workforce planning.
